This is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) project bootstrapped with [`create-vite`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite).

## Getting Started

First, you need to decide which package manager to use for this project. You have three options:

- npm
- [yarn classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/)
- [pnpm 8.5.1](https://pnpm.io/)

This project contains the lockfiles of each package manager, so before installing the package, remove unused package manager lockfiles.
